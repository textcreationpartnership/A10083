            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:1296:4"/>this Commandement, as hath not hitherto (ſo farre as I can learne) beene printed and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in our mother tongue.</p>
            <p>Sundry learned and godly men haue laboured verie fruitfully, in opening the ſenſe, and laying forth the duties of euerie Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the 4. wherin the practiſe both of the duties of <hi>Pietie,</hi> ſet downe in the firſt Table, &amp; of the duties of <hi>Mercie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb facs="tcp:1296:5"/>in a holy practiſe of all the duties of <hi>Mercie</hi> &amp; <hi>Loue,</hi> which he is to performe, either to himſelfe or to any other. For whoſoeuer doth walke carefully in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of this Commandement, maintaining that honour which is due to himſelfe, and euerie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, in reſpect of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent &amp; ſeueral yeares, gifts, and qualities, callings and degrees, in the familie, Church, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: hee cannot eaſilie be carried to exerciſe any crueltie againſt himſelfe, or any other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the ſixt Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: or to defile either his own bodie, or his neighbours, againſt the ſeuenth Commaundement: or to deale vniuſtly, or vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully about his owne, or other mens goods, credit, and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, contrarie to the eight and
<pb facs="tcp:1296:5"/>ninth Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements: yea, or to giue place to the leaſt ſpice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining, diſcontentment, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering motion, forbidden in the laſt Commandement of the law of God.</p>
            <p>There was neuer any diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and outrage, in any family, Church, or Common-wealth, from the beginning of the world to this day, neither can be: but it proceeded from the breach of the 5. Commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For how is it poſſible that there ſhould be any diſorder in the family, if the wife honour her husband as ſhe ought, &amp; he her? if children giue due honour to their parents, and they alſo deale honourably with them? if ſeruants do honour their Maiſters as they ought, and they their ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts? and if children and ſeruants do mutually reſpect and
<pb facs="tcp:1296:6"/>honour one the other as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them?</p>
            <p>Could any trouble and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ariſe in Churches &amp; congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, if the people would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſuch as haue the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of them, and do declare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the word of God, and in giuing honour vnto them would ſubmit themſelues, becauſe they watch for their ſoules, for which they muſt giue an accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before the chiefe Shepheard? And on the other ſide, if the Paſtors and Elders would feede the flocke of God which depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, caring for it not by conſtraint but willingly? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible, that euer any trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſedition or diſloyaltie could breake forth in citties or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, if people would honour their Princes, and euery ſoule be
<pb facs="tcp:1296:6"/>ſubiect to the higher powers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedient and readie to euery good worke? and if Magiſtrates in their places would gouerne their Subiects as deare children?</p>
            <p>Finally, if euery one that is an inferiour anie manner of way, would carrie the affection of a dutifull child to his Superiour: and euerie Superiour, the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a wiſe and tender Parent to his inferiour, according to the plaine ſcope, and maine drift of this commaundement?</p>
            <p>But what ſhould I need to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the truth of this point in many particulars? Search the Scriptures, turne ouer al humane ſtories, call to minde what thou haſt ſeene and obſerued in thine owne time, in the family, congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or any corporatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou art or haſt beene a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
<pb facs="tcp:1296:7"/>and thou ſhalt euidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that the troubles and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which haue broken out in them, haue alwaies proceeded &amp; ſprung from this bitter roote, I meane from the diſobedience &amp; breach of the 5. Commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. In which reſpect it is ſaid, that this is the onely commandement of all the tenne, that hath a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar promiſe of a long and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life, yea, and the onely Commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all the ſixe of the ſecond Table, that hath any promiſe at all annexed vnto it.</p>
            <p>O therefore, that there were in men, profeſſing that they will heare and do the will of God, the like heart to feare him, &amp; to keep all (and among all of the ſecond Table, ſpecially this his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement) alwaies, that it might go well with them, and with their

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea doubtles: for without that, good lawes are as a bodie without a ſoule, or life: or a good medicine without application.</p>

            <p>

            <p>Secondly, the greatneſſe of nature of the fault is to be diſcouered out of the worde of God, and applied to the conſcience of the guiltie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that ſo he may bee brought to repentance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the rigour and extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the law is not to bee ſollowed, and purſued at all times: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Magiſtrate may either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the fault in diſcretion, or deferre

            <p>Furthermore, the puniſhment muſt be proportioned according to the nature &amp; qualitie of the fault: ſo that to a great offence is due a great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: and a leſſe is to bee reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with a puniſhment agreeable.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the Magiſtrate is not to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh in reuenge or ſatisfying of his own corrupt &amp; malicious affections, but firſt, to ſtay the wrath of God.</p>

            <p>Secondly, it is he that teacheth the hands of his ſeruants to fight, and their fingers to make battaile.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, he giueth good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in battaile: which could not be, if warre were ill and condemned.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, when certaine ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being touched with repentance, at the doctrine of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him what they ſhould do in time to come, to pleaſe God: hee willed them not to forſake their callings: but teacheth them howe to behaue themſelues therin: which

            <p>Laſtly, warre cannot be vnlawfull, ſeeing it is an eſpeciall end why the Chriſtian Magiſtrate beareth the ſword of authoritie:<note place="margin">The 5 rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> as the Apoſtle teſtifieth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</p>

               <p>The ſecond is diligence and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes; which conſiſteth in often reading to his Scholler,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>Q. <hi>It may be gathered out of your words, that a ſcholler is to be brought vp, not only
